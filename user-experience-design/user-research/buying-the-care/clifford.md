# Clifford

**Screening Question**: What care and support services have you commissioned in the past year?

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (1).png>)

Clifford is the lead commissioner for health and social care services in his authority, including mental health and older care. He has recently taken on child obesity management – a subject he knows nothing about but he’s confident his experience will see him through.

He has worked for the local authority for eighteen years, starting originally as a Procurement Assistant and working his way up. Before this he worked as an advisor in Citizens Advice Bureau and was a volunteer for learning disability charity in his younger years (he routinely brings this up in meetings with providers). He remains committed to his job and to his ideals, but his enjoyment has paled recently with the increasing focus on figures over service quality and activities. He feels less creative and more at odds with providers as contract values reduce and he has to negotiate this with organisations he’s worked with for years. He finds that, especially in homecare, providers are extremely rigid about how they provide care and he sees very little joint working between them. He keeps asking them about community engagement, which was a key tendering outcome the commissioning team were looking for when re-tendering their homecare contracts: to date, there has been little sign of it. It's as if all the homecare agencies are operating in a vacuum that contains only themselves and the person at home. He's finding this extremely frustrating.

On top of this, there’s a flood of new legislation and guidelines coming from central government and he has to organise market participation in changing contracts and consult with many groups of service users. None of this feels like it results in positive change, despite what's being said in these consultations being written into new contracts. It's like nobody's listening.

Clifford feels harassed – organisations, local and national, contact him every day. Most of what he does is accompanied by nagging feeling that he’s not being fair – it’s only those who shout loudest that get his attention. He wants to connect with smaller organisations and the people who actually do the work he buys, but isn’t sure how to do this and anyway, he doesn’t have the time. Fairness is a problem, exacerbated by Procurement taking the duty to diversify the local market too literally. How to divide services across the region? How to assure quality whilst also remaining fair?

Clifford has gradually realised that most organisations (especially charities) will do what he asks – review the contract price, offer extra value like volunteers or a detailed evaluation piece. He has made a habit of asking about extra value with every provider meeting and has noticed how much extra work staff have done in response to his more searching questions. He’s finding that, because of his increased workload, he’s frequently delegating key decisions and tendering exercises to staff who don’t have the right experience. As a result, legal challenges have increased from providers over the last year or two.

Clifford wants to stay working in local government – he has his eye on the Director of Adult Services role and thinks he would excel at it. It would also provide for his three children to go to private school and allow his wife to cut down on her hours. He’s ready to weather the difficult financial climate and is reasonably confident that, at some point, the funding will be there again for services to re-expand and for his local authority to be more ambitious. He feels secure in his role and almost ready to jump for the next promotion.

| **Thinks** | There is a lot of unmet need and I have to be very, very discerning whilst also being forced to be unfair. I have to reduce contract amounts and work hard to get organisations to release their assets and reserves as added value.                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Sees**   | I see a lot of turnover and new relationships with organisations who have the reserves to bid for services. I see many more people at the market development meetings compared with the numbers of people expressing interest and submitting bids. I see more services failing and having to be turned around quickly by other providers in the locality. I see money still being wasted. |
| **Feels**  | Resentment towards central government at the scale of the reductions, frustration and powerlessness as I meet people who are really suffering. Defensive as none of this is my fault but I’m the one who’s always getting blamed.                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Does**   | I earn £55,500 with a contributory 10.5% pension. I no longer have to write specifications from scratch but I used to do this and now I review new services with my team and in collaboration with procurement. I oversee the participation and consultation exercises with every new tender and I meet providers during this phase. I am always the lead interviewer.                    |
