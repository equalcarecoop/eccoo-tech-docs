**Screening Question**: Can you describe the care and support you have organised and managed for your caseload in the past fortnight?

Sally is responsible for a caseload of around 50 people – up by around 20 from a year ago. Most of these have severe, life-limiting illnesses or conditions and require intensive, ongoing support. She gets a six weekly supervision session from her manager and case management support from her colleagues and a health professional via team practice supervision. On the whole though, she feels pretty alone. She’s recently had a couple of complaints about her work made by families and service users, but this is no more than her colleagues have been getting. She thinks of herself as a good and dedicated social worker but the complaints have rocked her confidence.

She qualified in social work 10 years ago and since then she has worked for two local authorities. The last few years have been the hardest by a long way. She feels like she’s constantly letting people down and forever the bearer of bad news – care packages are being cut and she can’t offer the same amount of support she used to be free to offer in the past. At the same time, she’s seeing the bureaucracy of funding get bigger and bigger as more barriers are being put in the way of releasing money and more back office jobs are being created to do this. It’s frustrating, to say the least – especially when colleagues working for the NHS seem to be able to breeze through funding assessments and always get the care package they request.

| **Thinks** | I am not helping people anymore – I’ve turned into the keeper of the keys. 80% of my job is now paperwork, not people.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Sees**   | The cuts to service provision are stopping people reaching the end of their lives from having the kind of death they want and drastically curbing people’s independence and quality of life. I see a window into their lives – a brief glimpse and then it’s on to the next person. Delays in getting funding sorted mean that people deteriorate and suffer more than they have to.                                                                                                                                                                |
| **Feels**  | I am appalled by the extent of cuts to services in recent years and feel both guilty and aggrieved over things I cannot control. I’m very worried about many of my cases and constantly feel like catastrophe is just around the corner. I’m exhausted.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **Does**   | These are my tasks: Care package assessments and reviews, log contacts with service users, complete safeguarding forms and manage meetings. I’m supposed to schedule regular contact with all my clients but in practice this only happens with the people who chase me, not the other way around. Meeting with other social care and health professionals. Going to court hearings and giving evidence. My salary is £32,500 and I work between 40 and 50 hours a week on average – I never take a lunchbreak, always eat at my desk or on the go. |
