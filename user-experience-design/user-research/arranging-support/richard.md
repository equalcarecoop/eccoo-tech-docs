# Richard

**Screening Question**: What’s been your involvement in the care of \[your relative who needs support]

Richard is an only child. He has a full-time job as a Digital Communications Manager in London and is becoming increasingly worried about his parents, who are separated but live close to one another in Lancaster. He works long hours and has just been given a highly challenging project with a top client. If he does this well, he’s in with a good chance of promotion. At a time when he needs to concentrate all his energies on his career, his mother Caroline has just been diagnosed with Alzheimer's and depression. This comes on top of his father Robert’s Parkinson's diagnosis a year ago. Robert’s symptoms have worsened considerably and unexpectedly in recent weeks. Richard was already quite involved in co-ordinating his father’s care (making calls during lunchbreaks, emails in the evening and at weekends) when the diagnosis for his mum came through. Caroline had been doing most of the face to face co-ordinating with the care workers as well as some care of Robert herself.

The diagnosis, however, has left her completely shattered and the local authority is making moves to increase the care package. Nothing moves fast in the council, however, and it’s fallen to Richard to find some interim measures to help both his parents. He spends most lunchtimes on the phone to someone – social worker, care agency, his mum and dad. Just when he thinks he’s sorted something out, something goes wrong. Just the other day a care worker who he really rated had to quit their job unexpectedly – the care agency say they can’t get someone in until the following week so he’s having to use a different agency to cover the hours until then. This means a fresh application form to complete and more introductions.

| **Thinks** | This shouldn’t be so complicated or take so long! I’m losing track of which carers are going to the house, who has got the keys and who knows what about mum and dad’s conditions.                                                                                |
| **Sees**   | Increasing distress from my mum and dad and a big bureaucracy which seems to be constantly waiting for confirmation from another department to act.                                                                                                               |
| **Feels**  | Angry and very stressed, mostly taking it out on the local authority and care agencies. I’m not really letting myself feel the full impact of my mum and dad’s illness because I’ve just been so taken up in the practicalities of managing everything from afar. |
| **Does**   | I research different care providers, make lots of calls, mostly chasing up things which have been previously agreed. I have to physically go to my mum and dad’s house to check the care reports and paperwork.                                                   |

| I need someone on my side who knows the system and can make it work better for me and my parents.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Paying for an advocate or support broker to manage the care and chase / check up on the social worker and agencies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | A ‘gap-minding’ package which includes 4 hours of free advocacy / brokerage whenever there is a transition in care (e.g. a reassessment of the care package or a move from home or hospital).

| I have a set amount of money to spend each week on my mum and dad’s care. I really want to find more creative ways they can be supported than just spending the whole lot on keeping the house neat and on their personal care. With me being so far away, this is very difficult to co-ordinate and I don’t know what’s available. | The local authority has a Connect to Support website which shows you what different organisations are offering. I can arrange a couple of hours a week with different places but have to account for all of this separately – the art class, the taxi receipts, the cost of the choir group. All the book-keeping takes a while and generally it’s just easier to spend it all on one agency. | An integrated set of options on how to spend the care package which goes beyond traditional support. Mum can do art classes and my dad is in a choir, they both get transport to and from arranged by the site.This is all paid for out of the single care budget and automatically accounted for to the local authority each month.                                       |
