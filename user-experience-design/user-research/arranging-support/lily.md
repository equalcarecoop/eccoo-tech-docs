# Lily

**Screening question**: Did you do the majority of caring for your relative alongside the 'professionals'?

I had to deal with so many people, hospitals, relatives, care workers, district nurses, staff in care homes, hospices, agencies, opticians, audiologists , pharmacists and doctors. I had to learn medical procedures such as using a catheter, recognising when Jack had an infection. I had to learn how to use a hoist, wheelchairs, and hospital beds. Due to the type of Parkinson's he had, it was very important he ate well as his tremor used up calories. I provided meals for both him and the carers. There was a lot of shopping.

I got very tired partly as I did not sleep well and Jack was awake in the night. The carers also needed to use the loo etc. &#x20;

It was possible to have some short breaks but they took a lot of organising, Some days I was working from 7am to 10pm at night (and me just turned 80 too!). When the carers couldn't manage they would wake me. When the carers had issues with one another or the agency I would sort it out.

He had so many diagnosis along with the original Parkinson’s, it was complex to look after him. Though I wanted to live with my husband till the end, he went to a nursing home. I couldn't look after him any more because I hurt my back and had a heart attack with all the work and the stress. I was in hospital for a few weeks. I was psychologically and physically worn out, by the time Jack went to a nursing home.

| **Thinks** | <p>I am overwhelmed and though I am keen to stay with my husband, I didn't manage it. </p><p>The finances are complex and I don't know how to manage.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Sees**   | There are so many health professionals to deal with. My husband takes on less responsibility as he gets weaker.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **Feels**  | A growing sense of hopelessness and helplessness and anger.  I am exhausted and worn out.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Does**   | I have taken on too much.  I look after not only my husband but care professionals too. I manage so many appointments. My diary is full. I fill in forms by the dozen. Getting rest is difficult as there are always people in the flat. Because I do so much it makes it hard to have a holiday. The issues of the carers become my problems. The dynamics of the agency and staff are ironed out by me! |

It is expensive.          | <p>The professionals share the platform and can share information thus each agency isn't asking Lily for the same information. Everyone involved can see the whole picture and what appointments are needed to be made and when they're happening. If daily notes are suggesting Jack has an infection because of the colour of his urine it can also suggest what health practitioners are needed. In this example there could be an alert after a certain period to call the Dr and then Pharmacy and it is managed by her team. Lily can step back from decisions. <br></p><p>By offering Lily a team, rather than individual carers. The team makes decisions. The team puts its experience together to manage the care and share responsibility.  They can share information instead of going separately to Lily.<br></p><p>By documenting all the work done it can help produce evidence for Jack's care budget </p> |
