**Screening Question:** What community volunteering are you doing?

> "I want to help out locally. I know there are people who aren't getting any help at the moment and I'm here and ready to give back."

Valerie is in her late 60s and has retired. She is in very good shape mentally and physically and she has been volunteering with a local charity, helping people with mental health problems.

She's started thinking about her own care and support and has recently seen how much worse things have become with the recent death of her mother. When you find a good worker you have to hang onto them as much as humanly possible. She found that the different agencies and charities who got involved with her mother weren't very well joined up. Things got scheduled that then clashed with the befriender and it was hard for her mum to remember who everyone was and what their roles were.

Valerie is keen to offer support to people but is also wondering what type of support her own financial situation will be able to give her when the time comes for her to need it.
