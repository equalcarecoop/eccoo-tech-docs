**Screening Question**: How long have you been working in the care sector and what qualifications do you have?

#### Description

Ellie has been working in caring roles for just over fifteen years. She started volunteering in a nursing home and grew very involved in the lives of the residents, eventually securing a permanent job there and working her way up to Level 4 NVQ in Health and Social Care. Following a restructure at the home she was left without a job and started as a bank worker for a domiciliary care company. The hours were very difficult and her pay had dropped by several thousand pounds a year to below the minimum wage because the company didn’t include travel time in her pay. She applied for many permanent roles and eventually got a job with a learning disability college, supporting the students with their personal care needs.

She loved the work but found some of the students, who had challenging behaviour, very tough to support. When a role came up supporting one person she jumped at it, even though it meant a reduction in her hours and pay. The college closed down a short while after she had left.

Recently, her daughter has been very ill in hospital with pneumonia. Her daughter’s partner has just been made redundant and they are in arrears with their rent. Despite Ellie’s long years of experience and her stable job, she still cannot afford to help her daughter out with the rent beyond a hundred quid a month. She feels terrible but she has had to ask her own mother to help cover costs until her daughter’s partner gets some income in and their benefits appeal comes through. To top this off, Ellie’s car has broken down a couple of times – it’s got 120,000 miles on the clock and has been amazingly reliable so far. Luckily it hasn’t cost more than a hundred pounds to fix but the mechanic is telling her it hasn’t got long to go. Without her car, Ellie can’t supplement her part-time work with agency bank work and will have to get the bus everywhere, again reducing the number of hours she can work each week.

| **Thinks** | I’m constantly thinking about money. There’s nothing saved for a rainy day, nothing for my grandchildren and I’m not getting any younger. Why do I end up going to people who live really close to me but I get such a low wage and they pay nearly double?! The agencies are taking all the cash!                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Sees**   | There don’t seem to be any stable jobs anywhere. Lots of my friends are constantly getting made redundant or having to move on for one reason or another. My colleagues seem to be getting less and less experienced in care work.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Feels**  | I love my job and I know I’m lucky to have found it with someone I get along so well with but I feel undervalued with the pay – I’m still earning close to minimum wage and I’m in my late 40s. I feel powerless to help my family when there’s trouble. And I’m really worried about the car breaking down again. I’m feeling exhausted and on the edge and really irritable. I'm trying to hide this from clients but they've started commenting on it recently. |
| **Does**   | I’m constantly searching and applying for additional hours, chopping and changing to find a care agency that suits me properly and can give me the hours I need close to home. I work a consistent number of part time hours (20 per week) but have to make the rest in an ad-hoc way and can only access work through the agency. Generally I earn between £200 and £350 per week.                                                                                |
