I've been an independent care worker for 10 years and I have around 6-8 clients at a time. I am well known in my community and it is quite easy to find new clients if I need to. I tried agency work; it was good to get training but the travel and the pay was a real issue. I prefer providing support to providing personal care and I don't like nursing care. I've been seeing the majority of my clients for at least 5 years.

If a client dies suddenly it can be really difficult finding people at short notice to replace those hours, so my income fluctuates a lot. I'm also feeling quite emotional about it as I spend a lot of time with people as they near the end of their lives. Each one is a personal relationship so to offer support to a new person takes time to find, talk through and decide on. Once I'm providing regular support I find it very difficult to find cover to go on holiday - although sometimes I think that clients prefer that they get a break from me every now and then! Sometimes it's nice to mix things up a bit and avoid getting into a rut.

Key problems across the journey

o   Selling myself

o   Negotiating rates with new clients

o   Dealing with negative feedback from clients

o   How to review practice and not brush problems under the carpet

o   Difficult to find time to meet with others to share practice

| **Thinks** | I think a lot about what my clients might like to do. I also think about how to develop the service I'm providing and whether I could employ others.                                                     |
| **Sees**   | Some relatives push care onto their loved one. Clients are sometimes embarrassed to be seen with a carer and they prefer me not to wear anything that identifies me as one.                              |
| **Feels**  | I feel fulfilled, however I miss having colleagues. I hate negotiating rates, especially when I've known the client more as a friend. I worry about pensions and about staying up to date with training. |
| **Does**   | I am in control of my hours and who I work for. I have flexibility about how I work.                                                                                                                     |
