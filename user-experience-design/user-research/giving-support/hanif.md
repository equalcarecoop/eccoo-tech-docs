> "I like being able to choose when and how I work and it's easy using the apps - I just wish the rates were a bit higher!"

I was unemployed for a few years before going into paid care work. I cared for my grandad when I younger, he was ill for some time and then he died of a stroke. I did a lot of the caring for him during this period. I previously worked in retail and hospitality so I have experience with people. I am worried about working in a profession that is female dominated. I feel pretty conflicted about the gender balance in carework. People make assumptions about you if you are a male care worker - as if it's impossible to be a straight man and to have compassion for people in a way that doesn't involve achieving a degree and status (like a doctor). I am still looking for a job I can develop in that also has some meaning and purpose but I like having control over my time, so bank work suits me. Sometimes the travel is pretty far and they only pay me for the hours I spend with clients, so that's an issue.

I wish I had known what the role actually involved though! On my first shift with an agency I ended up cleaning someone up who had soiled themselves - that wasn't in the job description! Although I cared for my granddad, I'm not comfortable doing personal care with female clients, which I think is the reason some agencies no longer employ me.

As a carer I work with incredibly demanding clients, but after a couple of visits, you know where you stand and what is expected. I often deal with people that can be rude and dismissive, but I take it on the chin. Despite having lived in the UK my whole life, I also get a few racist comments occasionally (mostly from clients but some staff too, though I don't think they realise they're doing it). I am vegan and I struggle to prepare meals with meat so I tend to work nights to avoid meal preparation. I prefer to do home support visits for people with mental health and learning difficulties. I prefer supporting older people though - I learn a lot from them and we have great chats.&#x20;

I have had opportunities to join care agencies as an employee but none of them pay enough to support my family. I need reliable, flexible work and reasonable pay so that I can support my family. When I first started working we nearly got evicted because our benefits stopped and my wage wasn't enough to make up the rent and food for us all. It was awful. I'm now supplementing my bank work with other gig jobs - I've just started driving for Uber, which has involved getting a new car and signing up for a lease agreement which I'm paying quite a high interest rate on. If I have a long call somewhere I'll offer rides before and after it to try and make up the hours. It's a balancing act but also gives me freedom to work when I want to. I definitely don't keep track of all the numbers.

| **Thinks** | It's a lot easier working for agencies that use apps but I don't understand why I still get minimum wage when they charge at least double that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Sees**   | A lot of confusion with co-ordinating support. Sometimes it's impossible to tell whether someone has had their medication or a bath. I have to ask and they often can't remember. Where I live, there is a stigma to getting external care.The women of the family are expected to do the care. Some of the older people I support are surprised that I'm a man. They have only ever been supported by women. |
| **Feels**  | I'm shocked at how poor people's diet is, it's all meat and no veg. I worry about how little I am paid - minimum wage is not enough. That said, I feel as though I am my own boss and and in control, not shackled to the loom like the other workers who are properly employed by the agencies. Despite the stigma & prejudice towards being a male carer, I get a lot of satisfaction out of the work.      |
| **Does**   | I used to report it when permanent staff leave the book empty but the managers change so often I sometimes get bounceback emails from people who have left and I haven't been told. Now I just keep my head down and do the job. I tend to get asked to do more physical jobs by my clients. They'll 'save' jobs up for me that they think are better suited to a man.                                        |
