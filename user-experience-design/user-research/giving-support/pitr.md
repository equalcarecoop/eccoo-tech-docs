**Screening question:** What lived experience are you drawing upon to help others?

> "Helping others is a way to help myself. It's a win-win :-)"

Pitr spent much of his twenties in and out of hospital. He was diagnosed with schizophrenia when he was 22 â€“ after self-medicating with recreational drugs for some years. This became a revolving door experience of being sectioned, followed by brief periods of community support, not-quite recovery and then becoming ill again. He didn't stick to the medication regime the psychiatrist prescribed because he ended up feeling almost as bad on the drugs as off them. Despite this he managed to stay in work, doing a variety of casual jobs. Whenever he earned money though, he earned in cash and spent it immediately, which eventually turned into debt issues with his utility providers, landlord and bank.&#x20;

After being evicted by his private landlord at the age of 29 he was put on the housing list and got a placement with a social landlord in supported living, where he was to be for the next 6 years. This was a much better experience, because it came with support to manage the array of benefits, doctor's appointments and debt problems. He gradually acquired more insight into how he coped with his mental health, consciously limiting his use of credit cards and re-negotiating his medication plan with his support worker helping to advocate for this.

He participated in a peer support volunteering programme, which involved a couple of days training, followed by regularly supporting another person with a schizophrenia diagnosis. He found it incredibly rewarding at first, but realised he needed to take a break from it when he noticed it was starting to trigger his own mental health. Although he had a named support worker, there wasn't much connection between the peer support programme and his own support. This meant he had a couple of bad experiences with the person he was supporting which he thinks could have been caught earlier.&#x20;

After getting some basic employment support he was successful in getting a part-time job working at a local restaurant. As his own mental health stabilized, he decided to give peer support another go through the Hearing Voices Network. This was much better supported and he went on to establish a local hearing voices group. He ran the group at the supported housing project for nearly a year with some wonderful success stories coming out for participants. Despite this, everything he did for it had to be voluntary. He started to feel resentful about this: he was doing good work, but because he was still a service user, this wasn't paid.&#x20;

The time came for him to move out of supported living as he regained his independence. This was a marvellous achievement and brilliant for Pitr, but the group suffered as a result. The only flat he could get was two bus rides away from the supported housing project. No one was ready to take on the facilitation and administration of the group after Pitr left and it stopped meeting. The social landlord hadn't budgeted for the group or offered it as part of the contract with the local authority and, despite having the funds, they could not see a way to continue it. During Pitr's occasional visits to friends still living there he saw that some people had experienced a worsening of their mental health with the withdrawal of the peer support. He found this upsetting and infuriating, sick with the injustice of it.

| My experience is not valued. I am seen only as someone who needs to be helped, not someone who can help others. | Volunteer peer support programmes, peer support jobs (rare) | Pathway to paid work as a peer supporter coupled with care currency that has intrinsic value, recognition of and respect for the value of this work. |
