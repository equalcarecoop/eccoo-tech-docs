# Sam

**Screening Question**: How many care workers / PAs do you employ?

Sam had a serious accident when he was seventeen – he was hit by a drunk driver and spent two months in a coma. He has been in a wheelchair ever since, with no feeling in his legs and limited use of his arms. For a year after the accident he struggled with depression, but he was determined not to be beaten and he went on to do his A Levels and then gained a degree in Psychology. He is now studying to be a psychotherapy counsellor and is halfway through the course.

Sam is very conscious of keeping in shape and goes to the gym four times a week to exercise his upper body. Although it’s difficult for him to use his hands, with his carers’ help he can lift the weights and use some of the exercise machines. He knows a great deal about nutrition and how diet can be best adapted to benefit wheelchair users. He has researched and developed recipes of his own and is often teaching his carers the best ones to use, both with him and others they support. Although Sam is pretty confident managing his carers now, when he first started out as a small employer he had terrible trouble with all the forms and with setting expectations for his care. After a bad experience with a carer (she argued with him and left him stranded at the gym), he got some help and advice from Skills for Care and went on a couple of training courses. He has a payroll bureau handling the salaries but he still finds the administrative side of managing carers a frustrating distraction from his studies.

| **Thinks** | I really like having control over when and how my carers support me, and the ability to choose my carers is fundamental to my satisfaction with my care. I really don’t like the admin side of things and still struggle when things go wrong. |
| **Sees**   | Too many forms and lots of hoops to jump through to ensure I’m employing people within the law.                                                                                                                                                |
| **Feels**  | Frustrated with the amount of work involved in being an employer but scared and unwilling to hand over control to somebody else. Alone in having to manage the HR and working relationships with me and amongst my PAs.                        |
| **Does**   | Searching for ways to reduce the administrative burden. Paying £30 a month to a payroll company at the moment.                                                                                                                                 |
