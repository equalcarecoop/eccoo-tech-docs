**Screening Question**: What paid-for care and support have you received in the past month?

> "I keep trying so hard to remember and to listen to what people are saying but no-one knows what's going on in my head."

Caroline is in her early 80s and has been very independent throughout her older age, becoming more so after the death of her husband ten years ago. She keeps active, going to her local park every day and teaches tapestry at a local crafts group. Despite having recent lapses with her memory, forgetting a few doctor’s appointments, recipes and names of people in the craft group, she has not asked for help and refused to discuss concerns with her only son, Richard, who lives several hours away. This all came to a head when Richard was rung by a neighbour to say that she had seen Caroline wandering outside on her street, walking up and down and looking lost. The neighbour had had to show Caroline where her house was. Richard drove up and took Caroline to the hospital, where she was diagnosed with dementia.

It took eight weeks for the Local Authority to carry out the care assessment and award Caroline with ten hours of personal care per week. In the meantime, Richard had arranged 14 hours of care through a local agency and was paying for this himself. The Local Authority contracted care workers and the one Richard had employed came through different agencies. Richard was concerned about the quality of care his mother was getting from the council agency, who always seemed to send somebody different each week, and decided to continue with the double arrangement.

After the diagnosis, Caroline withdrew into herself and stopped seeing friends and family. She stopped teaching tapestry. The people who saw her the most every week were her care workers. She was out less and less in public, afraid that the dementia would cause her to do something that embarrassed her. She spent a lot of time sitting by the window or watching TV.

| **Thinks** | There’s nothing left for me to do now that I’ve had this diagnosis – it’s just going to get worse and worse. No one takes me seriously any more. They never let me decide things for myself, not even what clothes I wear or what I eat.  |
| **Sees**   | People change how they act around me, they’re embarrassed and awkward in the group and my neighbour watches me every time I leave the house.                                                                                              |
| **Feels**  | Embarrassed and worried about how I appear to others, confused about seeing different people every week. A growing sense of hopelessness and helplessness.                                                                                |
| **Does**   | I let the care workers do more and more for me, until I never cook or clean and have to be prompted or have things done for me.                                                                                                           |
