I am in my late 80s and live in sheltered housing. I manage with very little support. I don't want to go to a nursing home. I would like to think I can get in touch with someone if I need more help. I am already finding it difficult to dress and cook for myself. My poor mobility is my main difficulty. I do like to have care workers, who I can have a laugh with and don't take life too seriously. I have osteoporosis, so am unable to leave my flat. I haven't left the flat for two years.  I need someone I can trust to help with my finances and do shopping. Ideally I would like care workers who have pets, so they could bring them when they support me. I am an animal lover. We are not allowed our own pets, but people can bring their pets when they visit.  I would also like to share a drink with people.  I enjoy having a whiskey. People can contact me by visiting me at my flat or by phone. My son keeps an eye on me and helps with shopping.

| **Thinks** | I am very alone and need people to befriend as I enjoy uplifting company. It would really be handy to know there are people I could go to once I need more personal care. ‘It’s a bugger when your buggered!’ which is my humerous way of saying, life is not easy at the moment. My main aspiration is to keep living in my flat as I like it and I don’t want to go to a nursing home. |
| **Sees**   | Carers are all people, he knows well, due to not going out, he is not meeting new people. He realises he is isolated.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Feels**  | He feels cut off from established networks of care, very alone.  He is pleased his son keeps an eye on him but is not giving him the support he really needs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Does**   | <p>He manages the best he can and he makes sure he does not fall as the ostereoporosis is worrying. </p><p>He copes by watching TV and eating ready meals.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| I am worried if I need personal care and help with dressing.  I am very embarrassed to have help with using the shower and talking to my son. Who can I call if, the independent care workers are not around? How do I keep myself out of a nursing home? | Talk to my son and two personal care workers, however I feel too embarrassed to talk to my son about personal care.  | <p>Offer a confidential service and do an independent assessment with him to decide on how best to support him.  In the assessment go into depth about the next 5 years and steps that might prevent him from going into a nursing home.  As he has savings that are less than 23,000 explain his entitlements for independent living.<br></p><p>Discuss if he would like professional help with showering and dressing and that he can have people who are trained and he does not know on a personal level. He can have different care workers that have different tasks.<br></p><p>Explain he could use equal care matching service and specifically find people who would be happy to share a whiskey with him and have a good sense of humor.  This can include using the database of peer support. Freddie is enabled to becme involved with more people as he realises he can offer suport to people who feel very alone as he has become aware of how his positive outlook dispite all odds has been crucial not only to himself but also can be of use to others who are feeling low.  He offers voluntary telephone listening and chatting service through the equal care network.</p> |
