# user experience design

User experience (UX) design is the process design we will use to create a platform product that will provide meaningful and relevant experiences to our users. This involves the design of the entire process of acquiring and integrating the product, including aspects of branding, design, usability and function.

This section will contain:

* [User journey mapping](user-journeys/) - the step-by-step descriptions of how people progress through different parts of the system (Emma's section - WIP)
* User research - research informing personas (useful as introductory / onboarding support for new members of platform team) + 'actual' user research
* [Platform Design](platform-design.md) - the overarching design of the system relating functions to user types.
* [Wireframes](wireframes.md) - structural prototypes of increasing fidelity that describe functionality that sits on each page / module of the system and how they interrelate.&#x20;
* [Look & feel](look-and-feel.md) -  design for the purpose of setting the tone of the graphical user interface, which includes elements such as colours, shapes, layout, and typefaces (the "_look_"), as well as the behavior of dynamic elements such as buttons, boxes, and menus (the "_feel_").
