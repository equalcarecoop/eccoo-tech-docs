# sign-up & first team

Numbering shows anticipated order of events

1. Browsing
   1. Public website contains example profiles of care workers and gives a description of what people can expect from the service, together with video and text testimonials.
2. &#x20;  Registration
   1. Minimum information required from care seeker on signup to allow them access to browse basic care worker profiles: Register with google/facebook or give an email address and name. Tell us whether you’re looking for care for yourself or someone else.
   2. Option to develop additional profile information at this stage but not mandatory.
   3. &#x20;Option to call direct or initiate video chat and screen sharing (where adviser may type some answers and user may complete others) instead of completing information online by yourself.
3. Worker Selection
   1. Care workers will have profiles which showcase their experience (including lived experience of particular health conditions), reputation, interests and skills.
   2. Care users then choose their care worker through browsing worker profiles, selecting people based on their personal traits, the rates they charge, their location, their background, their skillset and the ratings others have given them.
   3. As far as possible, the matching is outcome-based – people can look for improved wellbeing or increased independence rather than selecting purely on ‘time and task’ (i.e. 2 hours of care per day to cover cooking, cleaning, personal care and a walk to the park).
   4. There are two ways for care seekers to find the right carer, each involving different approaches to reveal preferences / circumstances and reflecting the needs of different users of the site:
      1. Filtering – This allows the person to see the widest array of real choices and is best used when the person or relative is confident selecting a care worker and wants to start from a broad set of options.
         1. Pre-filtered: Care workers will be listed based on location (postcode a mandatory requirement for user registration). They will already have set their own preferences for how far they can travel so will be excluded from user searches if the location for the care is too far away.
         2. Live Filters (which update as you change these parameters):
            1. Availability / times you want your care (regular time / ad-hoc / emergency / specific dates)
            2. Male / female preference
            3. Quality assurance level (tbc, depending on user research)
            4. Skills / experiences using a keyword search (eg dementia, wheelchair)
   5. There is a tiered quality assurance system, allowing people to make their own decision as to the level of assurance they want. For example, an elderly person living alone can choose the maximum assurance level, whereas a user confident in their ability to choose the right person from a wide selection can choose the minimum.
   6. Personalised – The site may also return a ‘best fit’ based on responses to a questionnaire.
      1. The person tells us what their preferences are and exactly what type of support they are after in a set questionnaire. This process also builds out a profile which the person can choose to make public to carers on the site (allowing them to be approached by carers too).
      2. Unlike the majority of questionnaires of this type, questions relating to personality dimensions are included – i.e. it includes relationship-focussed queries and attributes / themes for how the care and support should be given.&#x20;
4. Produce shortlist
   1. If they haven’t done this already, users will create profiles describing their interests, background, support needs, goals and desired outcomes of support. The profile will include a description of the most important qualities and skills they are looking for in a carer (e.g. speaks Polish, plays chess, has experience working with autistic spectrum clients). See Appendix 02 for a description of the profile questionnaire.
   2. &#x20;Shortlist invite sent to the care workers, who will be able to review the job and say yes/no to proceed
5. Video / phone call scheduled with up to four care workers
   1. Option to have this facilitated by an adviser
   2. Option to have a family member or friend present
   3. Example questions for the care worker provided to the care seeker
6. Trial shift arranged if both care worker and care user want to proceed
7. Follow-up feedback call from eccoo&#x20;
8. Confirmation from both care worker and care user
   1. Eccoo arranges care contract between the two individuals, including payment method
   2. Care worker and care seeker both state preferences for a maximum of two review points (e.g. after the 3rd and 8th sessions)
9. If it doesn’t work out within eight weeks the care user can repeat the matching process again at no extra cost.
10. For the first eight weeks, both care worker and care user will have access to the co-ordination elements of the Facilitation package and can upgrade to this if they wish.
