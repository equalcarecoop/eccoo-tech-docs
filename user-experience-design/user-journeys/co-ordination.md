# co-ordination

0\.       Pre-match, the customer can ask for a free targeted advocacy service. This is for people who have had a support package approved and would like to receive support from eccoo but are experiencing delays in implementation. Some common issues are: not getting their personal budget through in time, providers being slow to respond and get them support, social worker not contactable or not assigned. This service includes:

a.       Up to 90 minutes (tbc) of advocacy time where your advocate can:

&#x20;                                                  i.      Send letters and emails to your named Social Worker or Social Work Team

&#x20;                                                ii.      Schedule in and call your Social Worker on your behalf or as a three-way call

&#x20;                                               iii.      Act as a co-ordination / project management point for implementing the agreed care package

&#x20;                                               iv.      Give self-advocacy advice and template letters

1\.       Once a carer and person have been matched, their involvement with the site can end there, or they can choose to continue using the co-ordination and case management features. These automate administrative tasks traditionally carried out by care workers or a manager.

1.1.    Care co-ordination features include:

1.1.1.Rota management, scheduling, timesheets and automatic billing

1.1.2.Appointment booking (last minute scheduling) and emergency back-up for unplanned and planned absences

1.1.3.Maps integration showing shortest route and most efficient order of appointments (where there is flexibility on the care user’s part)

1.1.4.Text and email reminders of appointments plus automatic notification if your care worker will be late and by how much (based on location and traffic data)

1.1.5.Safety and security features including care worker photo ID, alert programmes e.g. GPS trackers with alarm buttons for care workers to wear, voice recognition

1.1.6.Calendar access and notifications for relatives and/or health professionals

1.1.7.Easy payment interface, billing and account statements for purchasers, reported alongside outcomes and activities

1.2.    Case (or care) management features include:

1.2.1.Direct integration into pre-existing support plan goals and outcomes

1.2.2.Use of externally recognised measures (Recovery Star, Goal Attainment Scaling, Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale etc)

1.2.3.Advice and insight from advanced practitioners – guided peer sessions where the team caring for an individual discuss their approach

1.2.4.Video diary/voice dictation for recording and submitting casenotes e.g. care worker dictates into their phone/tablet, reads through and confirms notes are correct. Other workers in their team can then either listen to the dictation while on their way to the client or read the notes as they prefer.

1.2.5.Interface with m-health sites (meditation, mood tracking, physical fitness, diet, specialist social networking) and integrated with health hardware e.g. pacemakers, blood pressure monitoring, sugar levels, safety alert systems etc. These interfaces are guided by care workers and led by the support plan.

1.2.6.Incentives to care workers for achieving independence/recovery with clients where this is a desired outcome E.g. bonus payment, special ratings, ability to charge higher fees for these priority outcomes (supercharged independence cf. re-ablement)

1.2.7.Scheduled, encrypted emails containing case notes to be sent to health keyworker/relative as agreed (GP, Care Co-ordinator etc). Relative / health care professionals can also have eccoo accounts displaying pre-agreed information. Email / account access dependent on preference and agreement from client.

1.2.8.Brokerage advice to design a unique support package making best use of personal budget and accessing the full spectrum of support options across diverse channels (such as employability, life coaching, counselling types, housing related, homecare, m-health) – connect with this at integrated advocacy stage also.

2\.       Working in teams: It is common for people to need more than one regular carer. DreamTeams are formed around the people they are supporting (e.g. Eric’s DreamTeam) and are formed automatically where there is more than one person regularly supporting an individual.

2.1.    The DreamTeam has shared systems based around each individual they support – casenotes, timesheets, rotas, risk management and record-keeping.

2.2.    DreamTeams can get matching T-shirts and their own logo, designed by the Team or by the user.

2.3.    Users can pool their budgets to make their money go further. For example, Eric has a DreamTeam of four people to support him 24/7. The cost of Eric’s support hours are halved where members of the DreamTeam also support Linda at the same time, who lives nearby and joins Eric at his home and in the community during the day.

2.4.    Each Team has a Team Page owned by the individual being supported – Eric’s DreamTeam, showing:

2.4.1.Support plan(s)

2.4.2.Rota

2.4.3.Casenotes

2.4.4.Positive Risk Plan

2.4.5.Safeguarding concerns and reports

2.4.6.Calendar

2.4.7.Tasklist (appointments, risk reviews, medication times, day opportunities, support goals)

2.4.8.Quality review results (whole team and individuals)

2.4.9.Team members (thumbnail links to profiles)

2.4.10.    Peer chat (messaging, video): invitation function and confidentiality options e.g. if team need to discuss and agree shared approach to particular challenges and themes for this individual.

2.4.11.    Quick access to troubleshooting/facilitation/ask-an-expert

2.5.    Eric, his relatives and health professionals can view the Team Page, make comments and ask questions. There will be space to celebrate success and to troubleshoot issues quickly – above all, dialogue is most important – between all those involved in the person’s care and support experience and with Eric himself.

2.6.    It is Eric’s choice as to how much information is shared with members of his team and he can set permission levels for members. There will be some instances where he will not be able to change these, for example, where care workers are providing personal care they have full access. There will also be minimum information access requirements for workers (volunteers included) visiting Eric at home. Eric will always be able to see what is shared with whom.

2.7.    Teams can be loosely organised groupings or work alongside one another every day. The single criteria for forming a team is if there is more than one person regularly supporting the same individual. For emergency visits from a care worker who is not already part of the team (e.g. someone who has been selected as a back-up via the matching process but has not met the person directly), they will be granted access to that person’s Team Page for the duration of time that they are actively supporting that individual.

2.8.    Unlike the Buurtzorg model, which forms self-managing teams based around fixed geographies, the team groupings are created around individuals. Geography and specific health conditions supported by the team (e.g. dementia, spinal injury, bipolar disorder) are secondary factor groupings which dictate the Peer Pages workers join. For example, you may be part of the dementia team, which arranges Continuing Professional Development, observation and supervision focussed around the condition, as well as the Hebden Bridge Peer Page, which is community-focussed and organises meetups, peer mentoring, local events etc. You can be in more than one team at once and it is likely that most of your team mates will overlap with other team groupings.

2.9.    The care worker also has access to a Peer Page, with membership based on who else they are working with across individuals and/or geographical boundaries. The Peer Page is there to facilitate meetups, share general advice not specific to an individual and connect with others to provide/receive peer support online (one to one or one to many).

2.10.                      Workers not on permanent contracts can be flexi, pre-scheduled or both. For example, a worker may set their availability throughout the week as 8am – 3pm Monday to Wednesday. This means they are free to accept regular bookings (which also fit with their other parameters such as location). They can also set their availability to ‘ON’ at other times, making themselves available for ad-hoc, emergency and back-up support for a period of time they choose. This creates scope for fluctuating rates based on demand and time of day.

3\.       Review points in place for both parties at 3, 8 and 12 support sessions (or other pre-agreed frequency)
