# care coins

\
14\.   You can become a Worker Member of the co-op through volunteering and peer support. You do not need to be an employee to become a Worker Member.

15\.   Work opportunities are available to carers, users and their families and members of the public:

15.1.1.    Carers can volunteer to build up skill areas for their career development.

15.1.2.    Users can volunteer to build skills and to support recovery and wellbeing.

15.1.3.    Members of the public can volunteer and opt to automatically donate the Coins they earn to the pool (doubling their impact)

16\.   Everyone, regardless of who they are or what work they are doing, earns Care Coins through volunteering. The only criteria for earning them is that their work benefits the members (groups, individuals or the whole membership) of Equal Care Co-op in some way.

17\.   Volunteering hours earned as Care Coins can be:

17.1.                      donated to a specific person, location or to a central pool for Welcome gifts of Care Coins and topping up the balances of people unable to earn Coins

17.2.                      stored to be spent later on for in-kind support

17.3.                      saved for a rainy day

18\.   The service will actively encourage peer support, where people needing care can also offer it and be paid for their time. They will be supported to do this by their carer (who in turn will be supported and trained by the service) and by others offering peer support to them, giving them confidence in their own ability to help others. An example journey:

18.1.                      Someone receives paid-for support through the service

18.2.                      They are given 10 Care Coins (these are hours donated by another participant) as a welcome gift and their worker helps them to choose their peer support. This may be based on skills the person wants to learn or support to solve a particular issue they’re facing at the moment

18.3.                      They are matched with a peer supporter local to them

18.4.                      The peer teaches them to self-advocate and accompanies them on hospital visits

18.5.                      The care workers of the peer and the person being supported by the peer ensure that the peer relationship remains a successful and healthy one (it is recognised in the care planning for both individuals)

18.6.                      The person being supported by the peer gains in confidence and is helped to offer their own skills and experience to others. They begin earning Care Coins, which show up in their profile.

18.7.                      They spend the majority of these on additional support and gift the rest to a central pool run by Equal Care Co-op.

18.8.                      The central pool then redistributes the coins to new members and to people who are being supported by the co-operative and unable to earn Care Coins themselves

19\.   The service will include these dedicated tools and resources with the overall intention of integrating peer support into the day-to-day activities of caregiving:

19.1.                      support plans which make provision for turning an interest into a gift (e.g. a love of walking results in a walking group) – recognised one of the Five Ways of Wellbeing (see nef).

19.2.                      peer support materials which teach people how they can use their own experiences to help others

19.3.                      links with existing local and national expert by experience and local peer groups

19.4.                      an ability to market your own lived experience on the website as a worker, comprising:

19.4.1.    dual profiles, one centred around the support you receive and one for the support you give others

19.4.2.    the latter profile is very similar to / the same as the paid care worker profile

19.5.                      articles and blog posts championing great examples of peer support to encourage others to give it a go

19.6.                      resources for workers to use in enabling the people they support to help others

19.7.                      dedicated training for care workers in empowering people to offer peer support and lived experience

19.8.                      communities of practice (forums, webinars) centred around peer support, recovery and protecting oneself (also available to care workers)

20\.   If the person has opted to join the co-op as a Supported Member but tends to do more peer support than being supported they can opt to become a Worker Member instead

21\.   Eligibility for Care Coins may be contingent on joining Equal Care Co-op as a Member (to be discussed), making this an exclusive benefit of membership.

22\.   Care Coins have history and identity – you can see which activities an individual coin has facilitated and their geography. People can attach pictures and poems to coins as they send them on their way. If that coin is created in the ‘real world’ its creation and its physical journey are twinned to its virtual one
