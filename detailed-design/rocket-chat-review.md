# rocket chat review

### **Background**

The first team were briefed via zoom and joined the platform in June 2021. Once a team member joined the platform, they were able to access rocket chat via the messages tab and also via the rocket chat mobile apps. The majority of this first team generally use the app to access and respond to messages.&#x20;

The rocket chat home page contains brief instructions on accessing chat via the mobile apps and tagging other members.

> Welcome to messaging!
>
> You can find all your messages through your desktop browser while logged into the Equal Care Platform. You can also download an app on your computer [here.](https://rocket.chat/download) To get messages on your phone please download the Rocket Chat app [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=chat.rocket.android) for Android or [here](https://itunes.apple.com/app/rocket-chat/id1148741252) for iPhones.
>
> Once you download the app it will ask you to sign into your workspace. Enter _chat.equalcare.coop_ as the workspace and then sign in with your email and password. Don't worry, you only have to do this once!
>
> Each Team has their own channels to talk on privately, but we also have the [**#everyone**](https://chat.equalcare.coop/channel/everyone) channel which is a place to meet and talk to everyone in the Equal Care community.
>
> You can find our Rocket Chat User Guide [here.](https://policies.equalcare.coop/-MMVTMtyasaYSErpshEt/the-platform/rocket-chat-user-guide) For questions, feedback and suggestions about the Equal Care Platform or Rocket Chat please ask in the [**#help**](https://chat.equalcare.coop/channel/help) channel and one of our Platform team members will come back to you as soon as possible.\
>
>
> **Notifying Other Team Members**
>
> To get the attention of a specific team member in a channel, type `@` followed by their username, for example, `@username`. The mentioned user sees a red badge on the channel or is notified via email or their mobile device if they’re not online.
>
> You can also notify everyone in a channel by typing `@all`. Although notifying everyone in the channel is useful for announcements, not every message requires this. We recommend using `@all` sparingly!

### rocket chat room/channel organisation

All members of the platform have access to the public channels `everyone` and `help`. These public channels have a pinned message 'Please do not post personal data or anything if a personal nature' as a reminder to users that these are public channels. The pinned message appears at the top of the channel on both desktop and mobile.

For the team, a private team and a private channel were created. `<person getting support name>-team` and `<person getting support name>-team-rota`. The person who creates the private team/channel can add members of the platform to the channel and they are identified as the channel owner. Once a person is in a channel, they can add others to the channel too. The original owner can be removed as an owner and another member of the channel can be set as the owner. These changes are made in the Members section of the channel (All needs to be selected as the default is Online members).

### team private channels

#### team

`<person getting support name>-team` has a Team's information section. This has been set up with a photo of the person getting support, a description with links to the Team Rota and Supportive Conversation documents in Google docs and a topic of '\<person getting support name> support team notes and shared info'. The topic appears as a subheading under the team name on both the desktop and app version of rocket chat. All of these can be edited by members of the team from within the Team's information section.

`<person getting support name>-team-rota` has been set up as a team channel within `<person getting support name>-team` and additional team channels can be added or created if required.

Within this channel, independent care workers describe their care visits, detailing - the time of the visit (recording any late arrival if appropriate); a general description of the person getting support's mood and demeanour; a description of care tasks undertaken; and a description of what the person getting support was doing when they left.

Typical care tasks recorded include, changing bedding and incontinence pads, medication given, food and drink prepared and given and how much was eaten, toileting help, ability (including mobility) of the person getting support, topics of conversation and reporting that water and emergency call pendant were within reach on departure.

Sometimes photographs of documents, eg Body Map, were added by the independent care worker when appropriate.

#### team rota

`<person getting support name>-team-rota` has a Room Information section. This has been set up with a description 'This group is for chatting about the rota, agreeing holiday and finding cover', and a topic with a link to the Team Rota in Google docs. This appears as a subheading in the team rota channel on both desktop and mobile with a clickable link to the rota file. (On the desktop version this is currently a little hard to read as the team banner is eccoo red and the link is purple). \
In this channel, independent care workers and people arranging support have discussions to agree and arrange the rota, availability, cover and emergency cover if someone is unwell. Sometimes, this may be a note recording a call or conversation outside of the group. Team members also update the rota in the Google doc and record their hours in vCita.

### onboarding instructions for new team members

The following instructions were used to support a new (giving support) member of the team accessing the platform and rocket chat.

These are the steps you need to go through to sign up for the platform and then access rocket chat from your phone. (If you have access to a computer, these initial steps are a little easier to go through via computer but you will only need to do it once).

* Enter the invitation code \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* (it needs to be in capitalised as detailed)
* Select ‘Give support’
* Enter your postcode
* Fill in your details on the join page (your username cannot have spaces or things like @ and it ignores capital letters, your password needs to include at least one number and be at least 8 characters long. Don’t worry if you enter something which is not allowed, you will just get a message asking you to change the wrong thing).
* You will then receive an email titled ‘Verify email’, open this email and click on the link. (You have to do this within in 5 minutes of the email arriving but don’t worry if you come back to it after 5 minutes, you go back to the website address above and click login with your username (or email address) and password and the system will send you another email link.)
* When you click on the link in the email, it will take you to a page which tells you that your email has been verify, click ‘Proceed' and then ‘Go back’ and you will come to a login page which asks for your username and password. Enter the details you added above and click “Sign In’
* This is you signed up for the platform.
* You will see a menu bar at the top of your page which says Support and Messages, click on Messages, then click on Login with Equal Care ID. You will see a welcome message and you are now signed up for rocket chat.
* At this point, open the rocket chat app on your phone. It will ask you to sign in to your workspace. Enter chat.equalcare.coop as you workspace and then sign in using your email and password as above. You will only need to do this the very first time you set up rocket chat on your phone.
* You will now be able to see the public chats, other platform users will be able to see that you are in and then add you into the private chats
