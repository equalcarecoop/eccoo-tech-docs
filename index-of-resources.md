## Platform

#### Platform G Drive

Contains all our research, photos, workshop days, raw materials, analysis, surmises and musings. You should explore this folder anyway - I have given a few pointers below but it doesn't include all of it. Key top-level folders are: [Discovery ](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1-E39YfN05sC6QK_4T-fTzhHRa9xauCmr)\(folders 1, 2 and 3\) and UX / Ayup folder. Go [here ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fuhaagfBdAdxlje5lNW3nvfPpkAyjE1yb0tPGCr4wt8/edit#heading=h.p4rrle5frio4)for a description of the whole drive.

Go [here ](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1QIKsa3lRHlgbpdGDxT9XBcwO1vpCUHkc)for our care workers workshop day outputs and one recorded interview.

Go [here ](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/13V8jGEEO3ULgG52uJFWCm-IECjzQDpD2)for our workshop day focussed on people getting and arranging support and several interviews.

Go [here ](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1jD1oNjdnJ2XfaVp7a8MBbZlu3TZCSZyE)for user research outputs from the Ayup prototype work \(the final report is in the folder two levels above - don't miss this out!\)

Go [here ](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1-yitidLQzgZrSKPDKSWdugFplVwi3yZq)for individual stories relating to co-ordinating care and support.

Go [here ](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1-yctnkxAOmoH_JNeghvqmKf30Z4ZfMT7)for Care Coins and gifting workshop research \(still relevant to MVP as covers considerations of voluntary work\).

Go [here ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SaPSm7ZLzQv49kBITnWD4nbz6F_t6tDuSzhskw-38Lc/edit)for some initial thoughts on how we can integrate co-op governance into the platform.

Go [here ](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1055C-Q4I64HHKNF_zdudDI1YeCmkvfib)for some work we did with a service design consultant.

#### Current practice relevant to the platform \(templates / docs\)

#### Business Plan

[This contains](https://plan.equalcare.coop) a lot of our personas and user journeys. It should really be in this gitbook but it's a pain to transfer. If you have gitbook access you'll be able to see the plan.

#### Policies

Although our policies site is also driven by our 'current-state' needs, it is a growing and detailed resource which codifies our approach and practice that incorporates MVP scope and beyond. The site carries many design/dev implications across the policies but key ones which \(often\) do not conform to standard procedural approaches and _**must**_ be considered in the context of platform development are:

1. [Roles and Responsibilities](https://app.gitbook.com/@eccoo/s/policies/safe-and-well/roles-and-responsibilities)
2. [Safeguarding](https://app.gitbook.com/@eccoo/s/policies/safe-and-well/safeguarding)
3. [Data](https://app.gitbook.com/@eccoo/s/policies/co-operative/data)
4. [Learning](https://app.gitbook.com/@eccoo/s/policies/co-operative/learning)
5. [Social impact](https://app.gitbook.com/@eccoo/s/policies/co-operative/social-impact)
6. [Trust \(& risk\)](https://app.gitbook.com/@eccoo/s/policies/safe-and-well/trust)
7. [Recruitment](https://app.gitbook.com/@eccoo/s/policies/people/recruitment)
8. [The Welcome](https://app.gitbook.com/@eccoo/s/policies/people/the-welcome)
9. [Matchmaking](https://app.gitbook.com/@eccoo/s/policies/people/matchmaking)
10. [Problem-Solving](https://app.gitbook.com/@eccoo/s/policies/people/problems-and-solving-these)
11. [Medicine support](https://app.gitbook.com/@eccoo/s/policies/safe-and-well/health-safety-wellbeing/medication)
12. Supportive Conversations \(not written yet tbc\)
13. Radical candour \(not written yet tbc\)
14. [Lone working](https://app.gitbook.com/@eccoo/s/policies/safe-and-well/health-safety-wellbeing/lone-working-and-visiting) \(work in progress - implications for platform and worker safety\)

#### Rules and bylaws

[These are found here](https://work.equalcare.coop/). They are not so relevant right now but they will become more and more important as we go beyond MVP. We want strong member engagement with our work and the operation of Equal Care Co-op. One of the biggest ways of getting that is integrating that engagement into the design and development of the platform \(members' area, members' tools etc\). These bylaws also have relevance for the operation of circles and how they make decisions.

### Asana

Tracking project progress \(or not\) of service mvp tools, automations and processes. [Board is here.](https://app.asana.com/0/1139769260183323/board)

We also have various service pipeline boards to track people's progress through the journey map. Individuals have their own cards in Asana and progress through Kanban boards. These boards hold sensitive personal data and are not shareable but the headings are as follows:

#### Getting support board

1. Interest Expressed
2. Supportive Conversation
3. Introductions
4. Check in due \(i.e. review point/how are you doing\)
5. Getting support
6. On hold
7. Ended

#### Independent workers board

1. Interest Expressed
2. One to one and application
3. Interview
4. Onboarding checks
5. Welcome sessions \(& training\)
6. Ready to give support
7. Giving support
8. Following cohort \(i.e. these are people we think are good but need more experience and we can't provide these opportunities at this early stage of our development\)
9. Goodbye / Long Pause
10. Out of Area

#### Gifting time board

1. Interest Expressed
2. Conversation
3. Welcoming \(i.e. this is also due diligence checks including DBS and references\)
4. Giving support \(i.e. giving direct support as a member of somebody's Team\)
5. Equal Care volunteering \(i.e. volunteering in the office or as a circle member\)

In addition to these boards we also have a **concerns tracker** \(for safeguarding, accidents, incidents etc\) and a **feedback tracker** \(for feedback, complaints etc\). The columns for these are the same:

1. Person who the concern/feedback is about \(as applicable\)
2. Understanding \(i.e. this covers reporting in all its forms, through a webform, verbally etc\)
3. Awaiting response
4. Exploring \(responding\) ie.. this is about investigation stage and deciding on what we'll do 
5. Outcomes \(i.e. once we know what has happened with the issue\)
6. Monthly reviews \(i.e. spotting trends, identifying learning etc\)
