# test coverage

### Summary

We need to ensure there is **full **test coverage of a systems features and be able to trace what has been tested.

### What is traceability in testing? <a href="introductiontotestcoverage-and-traceability-whatistraceabilityintesting" id="introductiontotestcoverage-and-traceability-whatistraceabilityintesting"></a>

Traceability refers to references/establish relationship between tests and requirements.

### What are the benefits of traceability? <a href="introductiontotestcoverage-and-traceability-whatarethebenefitsoftraceability" id="introductiontotestcoverage-and-traceability-whatarethebenefitsoftraceability"></a>

* To make sure all requirements are included in the test cases.
* Confirms 100% test coverage.
* Missing functionalities could be easily identified using the various types of traceability.
* Updating test cases can be done with ease, if there are any changes in requirements.

### Acceptance Test Driven Development <a href="approachtotestcoverage-and-traceability-acceptancetests" id="approachtotestcoverage-and-traceability-acceptancetests"></a>

Traceability is not need for acceptance tests as they are written within each user story meaning the requirements are under one specification - a "user story."
