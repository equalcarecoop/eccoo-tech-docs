### Screenreader compatibility testing

Screenreader performance is influenced by the browser. It would take a lot of time to test all screenreaders on all browsers. Based on the results of the [screenreader survey conducted by WebAIM in 2017](https://webaim.org/projects/screenreadersurvey7/), we will be testing the following screenreaders in combination with the following browsers:

\- NVDA with Firefox and Chrome\
\- VoiceOver with Safari
