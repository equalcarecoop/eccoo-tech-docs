# development methodology

#### Acceptance Test Drive Development

#### What is ATDD?

Acceptance Test Driven Development is an agile process which focusses on capturing requirements in acceptance tests and uses them to drive the development \(does the system do what it is required to do?\).

#### What is an Acceptance Test?

An acceptance test is written from a users perspective and is used as a scenario for how the software should work. This is written using the acceptance criteria for each user story as well as the accompanying designs. The development team will use this to make sure the system behaves as expected from a users point of view.

In summary:

* User stories tell you what you **have** to do from the users' perspective
* Acceptance criteria tells you **when** you have completed that feature
* Acceptance tests are scenarios which are derived from acceptance criteria and state **how** that feature needs to be implemented

#### What are the benefits of following this process?

* Collaborative approach - whole project team is in sync \(internal and external\) with sign off
* Manage requirements and even minor details such as non-editable copy for each view
* Testing is documented beforehand – able to pick out edge cases early on which is written under one specification, a "user story" and even define minor details such as non-editable copy
* The team knows when a feature is complete/ready
* Easy to define what is a bug/change request

### Workflow

TBC how this will work for Equal Care and how detailed we need to be but this is an example of how that process would work: [https://app.asana.com/0/1177634625229824/1181772304021830](https://app.asana.com/0/1177634625229824/1181772304021830)
