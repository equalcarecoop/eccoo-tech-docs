# creating a ticket from testing



Bugs, Questions and Change Requests can be raised at any time.

* Bug (a defect against expected behaviour)
* Change Request (for a new feature)
* Question (for a detailed question that may require group discussion)

The following outlines how to raise a **bug** that is not covered by acceptance criteria on a story.

**Summary**

Add a quick summary that allows us to identify the bug easily in Asana

Example: ‘Submit button not working’\
\
**Description**

This needs to cover:

* How the bug can be recreated with test steps (ideally with GIVEN, WHEN, THEN scenarios)
* What the ‘desired behaviour’ is (i.e. what should actually happen)
* What environment and device the bug occurred in (URL, operating system, browser version)
* Any screenshots or video recordings that can help reproduce or identify the issue easily

Example: ‘On the homepage under the signup for newsletter section the button is not working’.&#x20;

A user can enter their email address in the field but when the submit button is clicked there is no response message and they are not added to the newsletter list.&#x20;

Steps to reproduce:

* GIVEN I am on the newsletter page
* AND I enter valid details for the newsletter sign up
* WHEN I click submit on the newsletter sign up
* THEN no action occurs

\[Screenshot]

Expected functionality: The button should submit with a ‘thank you’ response message being displayed and the user being added to the Mailchimp list.&#x20;

Tested on: \[URL]

Device: \[iPhone / iOS 14 / Safari] OR \[All Devices]

**Severity Levels**

Using 3 levels for simplicity:

*   High

    * The defect affects critical/major functionality or major data. It does not have any obvious work around and is unsuccessful in it's function.
    * Example: A feature is not functional from one module&#x20;


*   Medium

    * The defect affects minor functionality or non-critical data. It is not desirable and may have a workaround.
    * Example: A feature that is not functional in one module but the same task is doable from another module.


* Low
  * The defect does not affect functionality or data. It does not even need a workaround. It does not impact productivity or efficiency. It is merely an inconvenience.
  * Example: Layout discrepancies, spelling/grammatical errors.

\
**Assignee**

Assign the issue to the developer who it relates to.



Note: priority of tickets should also be taken into account and can be set when discussing the issues.
