# introduction

The platform is critical to our aspiration to spread our vision to make a difference across care work in the UK and beyond. It will \(eventually\) support every relationship made and every caring interaction by our members.

This book outlines the [platform technical design](platform-technical-design/) and [software engineering](software-engineering/) approaches that will underpin the platform, as well as the [user experience design](user-experience-design/) focussing on the MVP - Minimum Viable Product - that we need to build to support this growth.

The purpose of the MVP is...

> ...to match people who require care and support with those who can provide it and facilitate paid and voluntary bookings.

### Some points of language:

For glossary stuff go [here ](https://app.gitbook.com/@equalcare/s/policies/glossary)\(work in progress like everything else\). For more style and content stuff go [here ](https://policies.equalcare.coop/-LeSN56IfWNpY00mY12i/writing-policy/content)\(mostly aimed at policy-writing but we're going for a style that doesn't really care whether you're writing a policy or a blog or an email\).
